Statistics::RankOrder - Algorithms for determining overall rankings from
a panel of judges

INSTALLATION 

If Module::Build is installed (preferred):

    perl Build.PL
    perl Build
    perl Build test
    perl Build install

Otherwise, using a Makefile:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
